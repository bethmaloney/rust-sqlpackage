review the @docs/reference_db_failures_plan.md and implement the first item that has not been completed. Once you have completed the fix commit the changes.

Implement functionality completely. Placeholders and stubs waste efforts and time redoing the same work.

If there are no further items then you must reply "ALL TODO ITEMS COMPLETE"
