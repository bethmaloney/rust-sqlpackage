Run the `just test-all` and fix the first failing test. Once you have fixed a single failing test you should commit the changes and finish.

Implement functionality completely. Placeholders and stubs waste efforts and time redoing the same work.

If the tests pass then you must reply "ALL TODO ITEMS COMPLETE"
