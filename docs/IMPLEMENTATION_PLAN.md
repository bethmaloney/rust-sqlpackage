# Implementation Plan: Exact 1-1 Dacpac Matching

This document tracks progress toward achieving exact 1-1 matching between rust-sqlpackage and DotNet DacFx dacpac output.

---

## Status: PARITY COMPLETE | REAL-WORLD COMPATIBILITY IN PROGRESS

**Phases 1-49 complete. Full parity: 46/48 (95.8%).**

**Current Work:**
- Phase 50: Fix schema-aware resolution gaps (remove fallback, add view support, complete testing)

**Remaining Work:**
- Phase 50: Remove unsafe fallback behavior, add view columns to registry, WideWorldImporters testing
- Layer 7 remaining issues: element ordering, formatting differences (17/48 passing)
- Body dependency ordering/deduplication differences (65 relationship errors in `body_dependencies_aliases` fixture - not affecting functionality)

| Layer | Passing | Rate |
|-------|---------|------|
| Layer 1 (Inventory) | 48/48 | 100% |
| Layer 2 (Properties) | 48/48 | 100% |
| Layer 3 (SqlPackage) | 48/48 | 100% |
| Relationships | 47/48 | 97.9% |
| Layer 4 (Ordering) | 48/48 | 100% |
| Metadata | 48/48 | 100% |
| Layer 7 (Canonical XML) | 17/48 | 35.4% |

### Excluded Fixtures

Two fixtures are excluded from parity testing because DotNet fails to build them:

1. **external_reference** - References an external database via synonym; DotNet fails with SQL71501
2. **unresolved_reference** - View references non-existent table; DotNet fails with SQL71501

## Phase 50: Fix Schema-Aware Resolution Gaps

**Status:** PHASE 50.2 COMPLETE

**Goal:** Address gaps identified in Phase 49 review - remove unsafe fallback behavior, add view support, and complete deferred testing.

### Problem Statement

Phase 49 implemented schema-aware column resolution but included a "backward compatibility" fallback that defeats the purpose:

```rust
// Old behavior (problematic) - FIXED in Phase 50.1
match candidates.len() {
    1 => Some(table),      // Unique match - resolve ✓
    0 => fallback_table,   // WAS: Still causes false positives - NOW RETURNS None
    _ => None,             // Ambiguous - skip ✓
}
```

When 0 tables in the registry have the column, the code now returns `None` instead of falling back to the first table - correctly skipping dependency emission when we don't know which table has the column.

### Phase 50.1: Remove Fallback Behavior (3 tasks) - COMPLETE 2026-02-04

| ID | Task | Status | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| 50.1.1 | Change `find_scope_table_for_column()` to return `None` when 0 matches | ✅ | Fallback removed, returns None |
| 50.1.2 | Update callers to handle `None` by skipping dependency emission | ✅ | Callers already used `if let Some()` pattern |
| 50.1.3 | Run parity tests and document any new failures | ✅ | All 57 parity tests pass, no regressions |

**Implementation Notes:**
- Changed line 1452 in `body_deps.rs`: `0 => tables_in_scope.first()` → `0 => None`
- Added `registry_with_columns()` test helper for creating registries with specific column data
- Updated `test_apply_subquery_unqualified_column_resolution` to use schema-aware registry

### Phase 50.2: Add View Columns to Registry (4 tasks) - COMPLETE 2026-02-04

| ID | Task | Status | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| 50.2.1 | Parse view SELECT clause to extract column names/aliases | ✅ | Reused extract_view_columns_and_deps() |
| 50.2.2 | Add `ViewElement` columns to `ColumnRegistry::from_model()` | ✅ | Views tracked like tables |
| 50.2.3 | Handle `SELECT *` in views by marking as "unknown columns" | ✅ | views_with_wildcard HashSet for conservative resolution |
| 50.2.4 | Add unit tests for view column extraction | ✅ | 6 new tests for extraction, aliases, SELECT *, resolution |

**Implementation Notes:**
- Reused existing `extract_view_columns_and_deps()` from `view_writer.rs`
- ViewElement columns extracted by parsing SELECT clause via sqlparser tokenization
- Views with SELECT * tracked via `views_with_wildcard` HashSet for future conservative resolution
- Added 6 new unit tests for view column extraction, aliases, SELECT *, and resolution
- All 990 library tests + 500 unit tests pass with no regressions

### Phase 50.3: Complete Deferred Testing (4 tasks)

| ID | Task | Status | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| 50.3.1 | Clone and build WideWorldImporters with rust-sqlpackage | ⬜ | Verify build succeeds |
| 50.3.2 | Deploy WideWorldImporters dacpac and verify no false positive errors | ⬜ | Use sqlpackage to deploy to local SQL Server |
| 50.3.3 | Add explicit test for table variable column NOT resolving to global table | ⬜ | `DECLARE @t TABLE(Name..); SELECT Name FROM @t` |
| 50.3.4 | Add explicit test for CTE column NOT resolving to global table | ⬜ | `WITH cte AS (...) SELECT Name FROM cte` |

### Implementation Notes

**Why remove the fallback:**
- The fallback preserves false positives for: external dacpac columns, view columns, misspelled columns, table variable columns
- DotNet has full schema knowledge and doesn't need fallbacks - it resolves correctly or not at all
- Parity test failures from removing fallback will reveal where our resolution differs from DotNet

**View column extraction approach:**
```rust
// For views like: CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT Id, Name AS DisplayName FROM Users
// Extract: ["Id", "DisplayName"] (use alias if present, otherwise column name)

// For views with SELECT *: mark as "has_wildcard = true"
// When resolving columns against such views, skip resolution (can't know columns statically)
```

**Verification commands:**
```bash
just test                                              # All tests
cargo test --lib column_registry                       # Registry tests
cargo test --test e2e_tests test_parity_all_fixtures   # Parity tests

# WideWorldImporters testing
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples.git /tmp/sql-samples
rust-sqlpackage build --project /tmp/sql-samples/samples/databases/wide-world-importers/wwi-ssdt/wwi-ssdt/WideWorldImporters.sqlproj
```

## Phase 49: Schema-Aware Unqualified Column Resolution (COMPLETE)

**Status:** COMPLETE - 2026-02-04

**Goal:** Fix unqualified column resolution by checking which tables in scope actually have the column.

See `docs/UNQUALIFIED_COLUMN_RESOLUTION_ISSUE.md` for full analysis of the problem.

### Summary

Created `ColumnRegistry` to map tables to their columns, threaded it through the call chain, and updated resolution logic:
- If exactly 1 table in scope has the column → resolve to that table
- If 0 tables have the column → return None (skip dependency emission) - **FIXED in Phase 50.1**
- If >1 tables have the column → skip resolution (ambiguous)

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/dacpac/model_xml/column_registry.rs` (new - 380 lines)
- `src/dacpac/model_xml/mod.rs`, `body_deps.rs`, `programmability_writer.rs`, `view_writer.rs`

## Key Milestones

### Parity Achievement (Phase 14)
- Layer 1 (Inventory): 100%
- Layer 2 (Properties): 100%
- Layer 3 (SqlPackage): 100%
- Relationships: 97.9%

### Performance (Phase 16)
- 116x faster than DotNet cold build
- 42x faster than DotNet warm build

### Parser Modernization (Phases 15, 20)
- Replaced all regex patterns with token-based parsing
- Created `BodyDependencyTokenScanner`, `TableAliasTokenParser`, `ColumnTokenParser`

### Body Dependency Resolution (Phases 26, 32, 34, 41-43)
- APPLY subquery alias capture and column resolution
- CTE column resolution to underlying tables
- Position-aware scope tracking for nested subqueries
- Handles same alias in different scopes

### XML Parity (Phases 22, 38-40, 44-48)
- Constraint annotation patterns match DotNet
- SysCommentsObjectAnnotation for views, procedures, functions
- XML formatting (space before />, element ordering)
- Layer 7 improved from 0% to 29.2%

## Phase Details

### Phase 22: Layer 7 Canonical XML Parity

**Constraint Annotation Pattern:**
- Single-constraint tables: TABLE gets Annotation, CONSTRAINT gets AttachedAnnotation
- Multi-constraint tables: CONSTRAINTs get Annotation, TABLE gets AttachedAnnotation
- Disambiguator numbering accounts for package references
- Median-based AttachedAnnotation ordering implemented

### Phase 35: Default Schema Resolution

Fixed unqualified table names resolving to containing object's schema instead of `[dbo]`. DotNet always resolves to default schema regardless of containing object.

### Phase 37-38: Collation Handling

- Created `COLLATION_LCID_MAP` with 100+ collation prefixes
- `CollationCaseSensitive` always outputs "True" (matches DotNet behavior)

### Phase 43: Scope-Aware Alias Tracking

**Problem:** Same alias in different subquery scopes caused incorrect resolution.

**Solution:**
- Added `ScopeType` enum (Apply, DerivedTable)
- Extended scope struct with per-scope aliases
- `resolve_alias_for_position()` returns innermost scope's alias
- Position-aware lookup during column resolution

### Phase 47: Column-Level Collation

Added `collation: Option<String>` to `ColumnElement` for columns with explicit COLLATE clauses.

### Phase 48: 2-Named-Constraint Pattern

Tables with exactly 2 named constraints get 2 Annotation elements (one per constraint).
