# Implementation Plan

---

## Status: PARITY COMPLETE | OLTP FEATURE SUPPORT IN PROGRESS

**Phases 1-62 complete. Full parity: 47/48 (97.9%).**

| Layer | Passing | Rate |
|-------|---------|------|
| Layer 1 (Inventory) | 49/49 | 100% |
| Layer 2 (Properties) | 49/49 | 100% |
| Layer 3 (SqlPackage) | 49/49 | 100% |
| Relationships | 48/49 | 98.0% |
| Layer 4 (Ordering) | 48/49 | 98.0% |
| Metadata | 49/49 | 100% |
| Layer 7 (Canonical XML) | 24/49 | 49.0% |

**Excluded Fixtures:** `external_reference`, `unresolved_reference` (DotNet fails to build with SQL71501)

## Known Issues

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Layer 7 element ordering (25/49 failing) | Cosmetic — DotNet's ordering depends on internal processing order which varies between fixtures. Rust uses deterministic sort. No deployment impact. |
| Body dependency alias ordering (65 errors) | DotNet traverses AST in clause order (FROM→WHERE→SELECT), Rust in token order. All references captured correctly — only positional differences. |

| 10 | Extended properties, function classification, constraint naming | 5/5 |
| 11 | Remaining parity failures, error fixtures, ignored tests | 70/70 |
| 12-13 | SELECT * expansion, TVF columns, TVP support | 10/10 |
| 14 | Layer 3 (SqlPackage) parity | 3/3 |

| 49 | Schema-aware unqualified column resolution (ColumnRegistry) | All |
| 50 | Schema-aware resolution gaps (8 sub-phases) | 34/34 |
| 50.9 | Decouple column and table annotation logic | All |
| 51 | Layer 7 canonical comparison test fix | All |
| 52 | Procedure-scoped table variable references | All |

| 58 | Security objects (CREATE USER, CREATE ROLE, ALTER ROLE ADD MEMBER, GRANT/DENY/REVOKE) | All |
| 59 | Database scoped configurations (silently skip — DacFx does not support) | All |
| 60 | ALTER VIEW WITH SCHEMABINDING (fallback + AST dual-path support) | All |
